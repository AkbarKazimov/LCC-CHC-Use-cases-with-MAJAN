MyWelcome App->Agent1 ... Agentn: **++1)++** TCN requests the CHC scenario and app informs his/her agent

Agent1 ... Agentn<->WPM: **++2)++** TCN's Agent receives the request and populates its LAR

Agent1 ... Agentn->Agent1 ... Agentn: **++3)++** The Agent checks LAR if there is already a CHC process being executed

Agent1 ... Agentn->MyWelcome App: **++3.a)++** If yes, agent informs TCN that his/her request cannot be executed now and \nit sets a flag (in LAKR) to execute a CHC process as soon as it is possible 

Agent1 ... Agentn->Agent1 ... Agentn: **++3.b)++** Otherwise, Agents start their cordination 


Agent1 ... Agentn->WPM: **++4)++** WPM is informed to change the status of agents

Agent1 ... Agentn->Agent1 ... Agentn: **++5)++** Agents work together to compute a CHC result

Agent1 ... Agentn->WPM: **++6)++** Agents complete their coordination and inform WPM so that it changes their status

Agent1 ... Agentn->Agent1 ... Agentn: **++6.a)++** If an agent has an active CHC flag, it initiates a new CHC. (i.e. go to step 2)

Agent1 ... Agentn->MyWelcome App: **++7)++** Agents inform their TCN by sending a single group of TCNs who are similar\n based on their personal information and preferences. Each TCN receives\n only the group that he/she belongs to
