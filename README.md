# LCC-CHC-Use-cases-with-MAJAN

To create AJAN agents who have the capabilities to run LCC and CHC features, add the respective .TTL files of agent templates and behavior trees in the &quot;LCC/Software/LCC\_Agent/Global Repos v1.2&quot; and &quot;CHC/Software&quot; folders to &quot;AJAN/executionservice/use-case&quot; folder accordingly. For more detail, refer to [aantakli/AJAN Service](https://github.com/aantakli/AJAN-service) Github repository.

To create agents, use the Postman collections in the &quot;LCC/Software/LCC Postman Collections&quot; and &quot;CHC/Software/CHC Postman Collections&quot; folders. The names of the requests in the collections are self-explanatory. [Postman installation here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/).

Refer to [MAJAN guideline document](https://github.com/AkbarKazimov/MAJAN/tree/master/MAJAN%20Guideline) (in &quot;AkbarKazimov/MAJAN/MAJAN Guideline&quot; GitHub repository) for more information about the behavior trees and postman collections.
